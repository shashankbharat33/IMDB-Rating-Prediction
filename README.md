# IMDB-Rating-Prediction

The major goals of the project are:
    How well can we predict the 'IMDB Score/Rating'.
    What are the factors that affect the 'Gross Income' of a movie.
    
The dataset consisted of 3650 records and 18 variables. The response variable is 'IMDB_SCORE' which is further classified into 3 categories of Low(0-5), Medium(6-7) and High(8-10).
Muliple Variable Regression and Neural Networks models were used for the score prediction. Accuracy metrics of the neural networks were found to be better as compared to the regression model.
On the classification side, KNN and Logistic regression were used to predict the category of the rating. Logit performed better with a accuracy of 80%.

At the end, Duration of the movie, Social Media Marketing(fb likes), Content Rating(PG) and IMDB Score are the factors that affect the Gross Income of a movie. Gross Income and IMDB Rating contributes to the commercial success for moviemakers.
